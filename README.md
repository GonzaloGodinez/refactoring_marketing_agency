As a Developer, I created this project to improve Marketing Visibility and Accessibility to the end user.
It reorganizes the main tabs of the engine by optimizing the search criteria.
The unnecessary code was grouped for clarity for future updates.
The use of headers, footers, navigation, main content, sections, elements, images, and sections was re-enforced on this project.

## Installation
